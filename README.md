# Complement-Creator-for-Technical-Enchant-Renewed

TE+ Complement Creator V1.1.4 for TE+ Renewed version 7.2.X

GREETINGS!
=================================================================

This application, made by Kendall Payton(Ziromanean#3173 on discord), 
is for the creation of custom complements to the "Technical Enchant+ Renewed"! Datapack (created by Frektip)
In this app, you can add many different items and blocks to the datapacks' functionality
and is intended to add mod support to TE+ Renewed by allowing the user to add whatever items they choose.

To run this software, open the "TE+ Datapack Creator.exe" file.
When you're finished adding items, press the "Build" button in the bottom menu bar to create a complement.
This zip file will be saved to the desktop.


Below is a list of the types of items that can be added thus far:
=================================================================
   * Ore Types
   * Swords, Tridents, Bows, Crossbows, Shields
   * Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Hoes, Fishing Rods
   * Custom Items
   * Armor Sets

(CUSTOM ITEMS)
=========================================================================================
In the Tools Tab, you'll notice a section labeled "Custom Item ID:"
This is where you can add modded items that fall under more than one category of tool. For example, some mods have tools that 
combine Pickaxes, Axes, and Shovels called a "Paxel".
Like the other Item ID boxes, enter the full item id in the textbox.

In the "Type" section, enter the type of tool it is that is being added.

Finally, the "Item Interactions" section is where you can select the kind of tool types that apply to the tool you are adding. 
Be sure to select at least one, or it won't be added.

(Full Example):
   ID - gobber2:gobber2_paxel_nether,
   Type - paxel,
   Interactions - (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel)

(ARMOR)
=========================================================================================
In the Armor Tab, both the chestplate and boots have some extra features.
Both allow for the user to specify the amount of basic Armor, Armor Toughness, and Knockback Resistance. These values are applied to the item only AFTER the 
Life Plus or Agility enchantment is added to the armor pieces.

Armor, Toughness, and Knockback Resist are measured as a decimal. (ex. 5.0, 2.3, and 0.4 respectively), and if nothing is inputted into knockback, will default to 0.0

(Technically you can make this value whatever you wish, but bugs may occur, so perform at your own risk!)

(PRESETS)
=
Currently Included Presets:
  * Gobber2 Mod
  
More built-in presets will be added in the future. For now, if you are updating to a newer version, copy over the presetNames.txt and presets folder to the new assets folder.

(Troubleshooting)
=
A troubleshooting button is present on the main menu. 
If your complement isn't functioning properly when in-game, there could be one or more factors involved.
These reasons could include:
   * You don't have the mod for the complement installed
   * There's a typo in a ID or number value
   * Complements might be conflicting with one-another
   * Your creator version is not up-to-date
   * The creator is not yet updated for the latest version of TE+
If issues still persist, please feel free to contact me and I will try to assist as best I can.
